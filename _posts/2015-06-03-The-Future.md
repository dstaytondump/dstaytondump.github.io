Just teasing what the future holds for my projects. Head over to [dstayton media](http://media.dstayton.pl) to have free media hosting. Have you heard of [🚫.ws](http://🚫.ws) or have you heard of [💩.la](http://💩.la/) both super simple webpages. What I am interested about them is that they are emojii domains. They currently to my knowledged only work in Safari. I want to make an emojii link shortener for iOS. I hope to have this working soon for you guys. I will put it here on my blog as soon as it is ready. Update again soon. Bye.
